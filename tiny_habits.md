# Learning Process - Assignment

## Question 1
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me was how a tiny habit can create a huge change in our life. The example of the pumpkin growing so big just from chicken manure made me realise that small actions can produce big results over time. Often, we focus only on big goals and get discouraged, but if we start with very small habits, they can lead to much better results in the long run.

## Question 2
**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**

In B = MAP:  
- **B = Behaviour**  
- **M = Motivation**  
- **A = Ability**  
- **P = Prompt**

To make new habits easier, we should:  
1. Make the habit very small so it is easy to start.  
2. Identify clear prompts or triggers that remind us to do the habit.  
3. Celebrate every small success so the habit becomes enjoyable.

## Question 3
**Why is it important to “Shine” or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebration gives us a feeling of success. Even a tiny celebration boosts our confidence and makes us feel good about ourselves. This positive feeling increases our motivation to repeat the habit again, which helps the habit grow stronger over time.

## Question 4
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting story was about the photography class where the students were divided into a Quantity group and a Quality group. The Quantity group was graded on how many photos they took, while the Quality group had to produce one perfect photo. In the end, the best photos came from the Quantity group because they learned through practice and mistakes. This shows that improvement comes from taking action, not waiting for perfection.

## Question 5
**What is the book’s perspective about Identity?**

According to the book, identity change is the “North Star” of habit change. When a habit becomes part of who you believe you are, it becomes easier and more natural to maintain. Long-term change happens when we focus on becoming the kind of person who performs the habit, not just on the habit itself.

## Question 6
**Write about the book’s perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**

The book says that making a habit easy to do is a key step in behavior change. When we reduce friction and make the action simpler, we are more likely to follow through. The easier a habit is, the more consistently we can perform it.

## Question 7
**Write about the book’s perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**

To break a bad habit, we need to increase the difficulty of doing it. According to the book, this can be done by making the cues invisible, making the action unattractive or inconvenient, and making the reward unsatisfying. When more effort is required, we naturally do the bad habit less often.

## Question 8
**Pick one habit you would like to do more of. What steps can you take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive, easy, or satisfying?**

I want to develop the habit of exercising regularly. I will set an implementation intention by saying, “I will exercise for 30 minutes at 6:30 am.” To make the cue obvious, I will keep my workout clothes ready the night before. To make the habit easier, I will follow the “Two-Minute Rule,” where I start by simply putting on my shoes and doing one small exercise. To make it satisfying, I will mark an ‘X’ on a calendar each day I complete the workout, which will motivate me to continue and strengthen my identity as a fit person.

## Question 9
**Pick one habit you would like to eliminate or do less of. What steps can you take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?**

I want to reduce my habit of scrolling through social media before bed. To make the cue invisible, I will keep my phone in another room or away from my bed at night. I will make the habit harder by removing the apps from my home screen or using a blocker after 10 PM. To make the response unsatisfying, I will maintain a sleep log to notice how late-night scrolling affects my sleep and energy. Seeing the negative results will discourage me from repeating the habit.
