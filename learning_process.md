# Learning Process - Assignment

## Question 1

**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

The Feynman Technique is a learning method in which you explain a concept in your own simple words as if teaching it to a absolute beginner, this technique helps you to identify areas where you are not confident so you should work on them.

## Question 2

**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The Pinball technique that showcases the difference between diffused and focused mode of thinking. Sometimes diffusing and moving away from work could help you to look through a different view. When you're stuck on something, taking a break, going for a walk, or even sleeping
allows your brain to work on the problem in the background and come up with solutions you couldn't find while focusing hard.

## Question 3

**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

Focused Mode (Active):
This is when you're concentrating directly on something - like studying for an exam, solving problems, or working on a task. Your thoughts follow familiar pathways, moving in a specific, narrow and predefined chain of thoughts like a pinball in a machine with closely-spaced bumpers.
Diffused Mode:
This is when your mind is relaxed and wandering freely - like when you're taking a shower, going for a walk, or just before falling asleep. Your thoughts take broader view and make connections that don't seem intuitive at first, like a pinball in a machine with widely-spaced bumpers.

1. Deconstruct the skill
2. Learn enough to self correct

4. Practice at least 20 hours

## Question 5

**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

1. I tend to put in a lot of focus and look through some predefined patterns, but now I would like to take a more diffused approach. I'll take breaks, go for walks, or relax when I'm stuck on something, so my brain can work on it in the background and help me see things differently.
2. I would also like to apply the 'Deconstruction of skill' technique to break things into smaller parts and pick the most important and frequently used pieces and try to learn that first, instead of trying to learn evrything all at once.
