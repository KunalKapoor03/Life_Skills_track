# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Question 1

**Which point(s) were new to you?**

- Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
- In meetings, keep your video turned on. It will improve the rapport with your team and help improve communication.
- Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup
- Look at the way issues get reported in large open-source projects.
- We recommend tracking your time using app like Boosted to improve productivity.

## Question 2

**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

I need to improve in the area of doing things with 100% involvement.
Sometimes I get distracted by social media or notifications during work hours.
To make progress, I plan to:

- Use a time-blocking technique and focus only on one task at a time.
- I nstall tools like Freedom to block distracting apps/sites during work hours.
- Keep my phone on silent and turn off non-work notifications.
- Track my work hours with an app like Boosted to build awareness of my productivity patterns.
