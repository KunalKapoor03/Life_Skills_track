# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

---

## Question 1:

**What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?**

**Answer:**  
Sexual harassment can happen in many forms, such as:

- Passing comments on someone’s looks or body instead of their work.
- Making sexist jokes, gossip, or rude remarks.
- Unwanted physical contact like touching, brushing, groping, or hugging.
- Sending offensive texts, emails, pictures, or late-night calls.
- Staring, whistling, winking, or making obscene gestures.
- Giving or denying work, promotions, or opportunities based on gender.
- Creating a hostile or unsafe environment through power misuse or intimidation.

## Question 2:

**What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?**

**Answer:**  
If I face or see harassment:

1. **Stay calm and assertive** — make it clear the behaviour is unwelcome.
2. **Record details** — note date, time, place, and people involved.
3. **Report immediately** — to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), HR, or manager.
4. **Support the victim** if I witness harassment, by standing with them and encouraging them to report.
5. **Do not ignore** even “small” incidents, as they can grow worse over time.
6. **Follow company policy** and trust the process for fair investigation.
