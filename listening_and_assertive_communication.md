## Question 5

**When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?**

I usually become passive when I'm talking to people who are older or in authority - like teachers, parents, or relatives. Even if I don't agree with something, I just stay quiet and go along with it to avoid conflict.

I also become passive with friends sometimes when everyone is making plans and I don't really want to go somewhere, but I say "yeah, okay" anyway because I don't want to be the one person who says no and ruins the mood.

Another time is during family gatherings when uncles and aunts ask annoying questions about my marks or future plans. Even if their comments are irritating, I just smile and give short answers instead of telling them how I actually feel.

Basically, I switch to passive style when I feel like speaking up will either create unnecessary drama, hurt someone's feelings, or when I feel like my opinion won't really matter anyway in the situation.

## Question 6

**When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?**

I usually become aggressive when someone messes with my personal space or belongings. I really like keeping things clean and organized, and if someone doesn't respect that, I get pretty aggressive about it.

I also get aggressive when I see people being messy in shared spaces - like leaving the bathroom dirty or not putting things back where they belong. I can't just ignore it. I'll directly confront them and make it very clear that it's not acceptable.

Another situation is when I'm stressed or concentrated and someone disturbs me or asks me to do something else. I snap at them quite harshly instead of calmly explaining that I'm busy.

## Question 7

**When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?**

I become passive aggressive mostly sarcastic when I want someone to know I'm upset without getting into a direct confrontation about it.

When my family makes decisions without asking me, I don't argue. I just go along with it but make my displeasure obvious through sighs, eye rolls, or saying "Fine, whatever you want" in a flat tone.

## Question 8

**How can you make your communication assertive?**

**1. Use "I" statements instead of "You" accusations**

Rather than saying accusatory statements, I should express how I feel using "I" statements. I should adapt a way in which I'm expressing my feelings without attacking the other person.

**2. Be clear and direct about what I want**

I need to communicate in a straightforward way that directly states my thoughts and feelings without expecting people to read my mind.

**3. Learn to say "NO" without feeling guilty**

It's okay to refuse requests even if it feels uncomfortable. I don't have to agree to everything people ask of me.

**4. Acknowledge others' feelings while standing my ground**

Assertiveness isn't about ignoring others - it's about respecting both myself and them. I can show I'm listening but also have my own needs.
